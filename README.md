# Materialize Cloud SDKs

⚠️⚠️ **WARNING!** ⚠️⚠️ The Materialize Cloud SDKs are under active development.

This repository contains software development kits (SDKs) for [Materialize
Cloud] in several languages. These SDKs provide high-level, type-safe bindings
over Materialize Cloud's HTTP API.

SDKs are currently available for the following languages:

  * [Go](./go)
  * [Python](./python)
  * [Rust](./rust)

If an SDK is not available, you can make requests to the API directly using
an HTTP client in your language:

  * [Browsable API documentation](https://cloud.materialize.com/api/schema/browse)
  * [OpenAPI definition](./schema.yml)
